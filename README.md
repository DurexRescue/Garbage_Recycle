## Garbage Recycle

Welcome to Garbage Recycle! 

You're on your way to find a nice platform of garbage recycling! Here's some of the things you'll want to check out.

 ##  Sign In Firstly

When you open the system, you need to click “login” first and authorize WeChat！

##  Two Ends

The system has two ends, one is the user end and the other is the merchant end. In the code, the naming method on the user side is "_user". For example, the order page on the merchant side is named "order", and the order page on the user side is named "order_user", as are other pages.

## Backend Implementation

The system uses WeChat cloud development as the back-end implementation, the database is stored in the cloud database, and the pictures are stored in the cloud. The front end accesses the database through the interface in wx.cloud.

>  **If you can not access the cloud database,you should make sure that you have modified your DNS Address to '8.8.8.8'.Hope that this might help you!** 

##  Intelligent recognition of garbage classification

 We use the interface of Baidu cloud image recognition platform to realize the function of intelligently identifying garbage classification.

For the real-time tracking module of waste products, our solution is to use the map component in the development of Tencent WeChat applet to realize the positioning function.
